ReadAndChat is a simple web app built with spring boot, java.
From the name, you probably guessed that it has a library and at least a chat room. Correct!
Authenticated users can read any book in the library and chat with other users. That's basically it.
The admin is the only user with authorities to add or delete books from the library. 
The admin can equally give an existing user admin priviledges or 'unadmin' an existing admin.
